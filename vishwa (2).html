    <h2>Its the difference between life and death</h2>
<p>
One of the biggest problems society faces today is coexisting, this problem goes beyond the work place, or family life, it also extends to our roads. Most injuries resulting from car accidents were completely preventable using proper traffic safety. 

“About 1.25 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years.”  </p>
      <h2>Traffic Safety Tips for Pedestrians</h2>
<p>
 *Never Assume a Driver Has Seen You: Be aware of cars turning into or getting out of driveways, or parking spaces. Stop, and make sure the driver has seen you before continuing. Also, when you are crossing a street or intersection, make eye contact with the drivers to be sure they have seen you.<br>

 *Use the Sidewalks: Sidewalks are roads for pedestrians, use them, they are there for your safety. If there are no sidewalks available, always walk facing traffic, and take extra precautions when walking around curves in the road, as visibility for motorist is limited and they may not see you.<br>

*Use Crosswalks: If you need to cross a street or intersection, look for a crosswalk, if there none, keep in mind that as a pedestrian, you must yield to all other traffic when crossing, make sure you are crossing in a well-lit area with good visibility.<br>

 *Be Alert: These days it’s easy for us to become distracted by our mobile devices; these distractions are responsible many accidents. Keep your eyes on the road as you walk or run, if you are listening to music, make sure the volume allows you to still hear what is going on around you.<br>

  * Make Yourself Visible: This is especially important at night; if you plan to go for a walk, jog, or a run, at night make sure you wear light colored, reflective clothing.<br></p>

     <h2>Traffic Safety Tips for Drivers</h2>
<p>
  *Obey Speed Limits: We understand the need to be on time, and we even understand the thrill of fast driving, but speed limits are in place to safeguard all who travel on that road. Did you know that a pedestrian hit by a car going 40 mph has an 85% chance of being killed, while the risk at 20 mph is only 5%?<br>
  *Expect and look for Pedestrians, Runners, Cyclists, and Motorcycles: Some roads prohibit pedestrians and cyclist but there is still a chance you will encounter one. <br>Drive with the mindset that there might be others on the road, look out for them and respect their space.
  *Respect All Traffic Signals: Come to a complete stop when you encounter a stop sign or red light. Signal your turns and look both ways when changing lanes.<br>
   *Respect Cyclists: Cyclists cannot ride on sidewalks, they must do so on the road, this means they have the same responsibilities and rights as motorcar drivers. <br>When passing a cyclist always give them at least 3 feet for safety, never honk as you approach them, as this may startle them and cause an accident. Before you open your door make sure there are no cyclists coming that can crash against your door.<br>
   *Never Drive Under the Influence or When Overly Tired: Impaired driving is the leading cause of traffic accidents, if you have been drinking alcohol, have taken any drugs, prescription or otherwise, that can impair your driving, or are exhausted for any reason, do everyone a favor, and call a cab or opt for public transportation.<br>"""

   *Be a Defensive Driver. Remember that many drivers DO NOT practice proper traffic safety. By staying alert to other drivers, you may avoid an accident. Do not fall into road rage, this can only aggravate the problem.<br>
   *Be Aware of Weather Dangers. Make sure that your vehicle is rain-ready. Keep in mind that during a rainstorm you could stand to lose two-thirds of your traction. With this in mind, please driver slower, two-thirds slower could be a good rule to follow. Appy the three-second rule during moments of poor visibility to allow yourself a safe stopping distance.<br></p>
